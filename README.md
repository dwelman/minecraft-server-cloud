# Minecraft Server Cloud
A project to sharpen my skills with various cloud technologies and IAC tooling while having fun, the end goal being able to provision a modded minecraft server from scratch and to host it in the cloud.

The first cloud environment I will focus on is GCP, with Azure and AWS to follow.
